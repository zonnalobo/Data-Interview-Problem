We came across this project on the internet and try to finish it.
The project contains four topics:
  1. The first is Algoritmic Solving
      It is how to build an algoritmic to minimize the cost provided in the problems.
  2. The Second is Big Data
      It is how to manage used memory in handling big data
  3. The third is Machine Learning
      This contains some questions about machine learning such as how to handling imbalance data
  4. The last is Statistics
      There are some questions about probability here.
